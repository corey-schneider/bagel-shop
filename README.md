### Credit to open-source contributors

Bagel Patch uses a number of open-source projects to work properly:
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - Open-source CSS framework *(this makes the website pretty)*
* [jQuery] - A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library
* [Ruby on Rails] - Web application framework

# TO DO:
* Enable "articles" (section 5 of https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) - Make a portal and tie this into "deals" so logged-in users can edit / delete deals, testimonials, pictures, etc
* Add picture gallery section
* Add contact us section with a space for a user to leave a testimonial that can be featured (and a chance to win a dozen bagels or something)
* Sign up with your email for exclusive offers? Point system with accounts maybe?
