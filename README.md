### Credit to open-source contributors

Bagel Patch uses a number of open-source projects to work properly:
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - Open-source CSS framework *(this makes the website pretty)*
* [jQuery] - A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library
* [Ruby on Rails] - Web application framework

#

# TO DO:
* <s>Enable "articles" (section 5 of https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)</s>
* Make a portal <s>and tie this into "deals" so logged-in users can edit / delete deals</s>, testimonials, pictures, etc
* Add picture gallery section
* Add contact us section with a space for a user to leave a testimonial that can be featured (and a chance to win a dozen bagels or something)
* Sign up with your email for exclusive offers? Point system with accounts maybe?
* Leave website feedback in bottom right corner - Add CAPTCHA for this
* Add map
* Add all contents of menu
* Make login email non-case sensitive
* <s>Click on carousel to be taken to the menu</s>
* <s>Clickable phone / address links in footer</s>
* Make the navigation bar look less like puke
* <s>Make navigation bar work for mobile users</s>
* Add content to Contact section
* <s>Do not allow non-logged in users to edit / delete / create any articles</s>
* <b>Do not allow non-logged in users to view / edit / delete / create any users (/users)</b>
* Add 404 pages before publishing
* HTTPS?
* Visiting /login while logged in allows you to log in again. Remove that
* Brute force password protection
* Change password minimum from 6 --> 8
